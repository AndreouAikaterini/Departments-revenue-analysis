# Departments-revenue-analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook along with two CSV files that serve as the dataset.

The analysis utilizes pandas to explore, clean, and manipulate departmental data. 
The process begins with basic inspection and data cleaning, followed by filtering, dataset merging, and advanced filtering using multiple conditions. 
Finally, the data is grouped to extract meaningful insights.

The tasks performed in this analysis include:
1. Reading the Data
2. Inspecting Data Types and Dimensions
3. Data Cleaning
4. Basic Data Filtering
5. Merging Datasets
6. Applying Advanced Filtering with Multiple Conditions
7. Grouping and Aggregating Data for Insights
